<!-- The task being -> to produce a webpage from scratch, using css and html. This webpage was to follow the precise dimensions which its mockup provided

    The problem solving thought process used to create each of these sections was appropriated from my studies in Physics
    and applied for this web development bootcamp project, this approach was 
        -> write down what you want
        -> write down what you know 
        -> think of different bridges to get there
        -> pick the one which would be the most likely to work 
        -> execute that bridge 
        -> if it doesn't work try another one 
        -> try and fail on repeat at the different ways of getting there until it works 
        -> analyse the result and check its similarity to what we want
    
    The approach that worked for this project was 
        Content consumption
            -> consume the course content and make notes on it 
            -> attend lectures 

        Problem solving 
            -> treat each section of the webpage like a problem 
            -> split that problem into smaller problems and combine them into sections of the webpage 
            -> then combine the various sections of the webpage 

    Each of these sections is annotated in brevity with these problem solving thought processes, with a view to completing the project assessment

                -> we want 
                    -> the Booki logo to the left of the screen 
                    -> then the accommodation / Things to do section
                -> we know 
                    -> the notes we made from the courses on the OpenClassrooms platform 
                    -> the relative file path to the Booki logo 
                    -> the two elements on the top RHS of the page have the same overline - they look like they use the same classes  
                -> bridges 
                    -> create an unordered list, flexbox the items sideways (on a row), and then get rid of the bullet points
                    -> css borders
                    -> create the two elements on the top RHS of the page using the same css class, then put a larger div around them 
                        then flexbox them sideways 
                    -> get in the Booki logo with an svg or <img> tag, and then flexbox that in or combine it with the other elements 
                        under another div 
                -> learnings after doing the section
                    -> prefer divs over unordered lists 
                        -> the idea of - making a nav bar from an unordered list, getting rid of the bullet points and flexboxing everything into
                        a row was less effective and so divs were used instead
                        -> this shows that the preferred method for doing this in terms of efficiency should be the div (not unordered list) approach
                    -> use an agile approach - check it constantly/ split the section you are working on into micro problems
                        -> check the image matches the one you want - I inserted the logo as an svg and a part of it was missing
                    -> when you make buttons 
                        -> you don't want the link to only go around the text, you want it to go around the entire thing
                        -> so you need to put the entire thing in a link (not the <a> tag only around the text) 
                        -> you can hyperlink something back to the same page - it doesn't actually need a link around it, you can 
                            add another class to change the mouse for certain states
                    -> think of the entire thing in terms of rectangles, break the section into - the thought process is - 
                        -> break the section into rectangles / smaller molecules
                        -> make those with divs
                        -> combine everything together -->

                    -> it looks like it's the same for all of the breakpoints <- we haven't been asked to consider how it behaves below the 
                        mobile breakpoint in the project brief 
                -> we know 
                    -> the input form will need another div around it because generally those are infinite
                    -> the svg of the icon 
                    -> all of the information from the mockup in Figma
                    -> something about - 
                        -> active states
                        -> hover states
                        -> focus state
                -> bridges 
                    -> these items look like they've been flexboxed apart vertically 
                    -> we can add some sort of link around the blue search button 
                    -> for the two top sections of text 
                        -> I would make those in the code sandbox at the bottom of the html file 
                        -> and then format them in css
                    -> then we have the 
                    -> the three sections which make up the search bar
                    -> those would be done separately, then put into a larger div and flexboxed
                        -> we also know the widths have to be done in percentages for the project, but we don't care as much about the heights 
                        -> so we would make the three sections individually, then flexbox them together, then combine them with the text from the 
                            first part 
                        -> for the svg on the right <- export it from Figma
                        -> then for the part in the middle of the search bar -> stack overflow for input tags, make it in the html sandbox 
                            and then paste it in 
                        -> for the blue search icon on the RHS, the most technical part will probably be the 
                            either the link around it or the radius in css 
                    -> so the plan is 
                        -> first do the sections then combine them 
                        -> start with the text at the top because it's the easiest -> format this in css with the parameters we know from 
                            the Figma mockup 
                        -> then work on each of the three sections of the search bar -> going from left to right 
                        -> then combine those into one flexbox 
                        -> then flexbox that with the text from before
                -> learnings after doing the section
                        -> the text before the search bar was fine
                        -> the problems and learnings with the search bar were 
                            - svgs can be difficult in terms of sizing - check the sizing in the console if something doesn't look right 
                            - don't measure the width of something with a ruler on your computer, count the actual pixels on the mockup
                            - input divs are infinite search boxes, you need to put another div around them or the search box will be infinite
                            - put links around the entire container rather than just the text - if you are making buttons 
                                -> you want the link to show when you hover over the entire button
                        -> use aria-labels for accessibility text on svg icons, and alt text for screen reading images

                    -> learnings after doing the section
                        -> id'ing each of the buttons worked well because they each had different widths 
                        -> I used images and then got rid of them for svgs, the lesson is - if you have icons, prefer svgs over jpegs or pngs 
                            - svgs for icons unless told otherwise etc
                        ->  we were right in the sense that the styling of these paragraph elements was the same for each button element,
                         and so these paragraph elements were styled using the same class (content-for-buttons)
                            -> pick out elements which are repeating, design a generic class of those elements and then reuse it 
                            -> the 'reuse parts of the webpage' strategy seems to work

                        -> the convenience of identifying repeated elements in the code - and then copying and pasting them and changing the content for those 
                            instances of the classes 
                            -> there were two types of cards (6 of one type and 3 of the other)
                                -> recognising the similarities between these two card types increased the efficiency of the code 
                                    production, as it allowed for one card type to be initialised from another
                                -> for a given class of card, in order to create a new instance the only change which was required was the change 
                                    in its content 
                                -> reusing the code both from one card type to start as a basis for creating another card type and the functionality 
                                    that being able to generate instances of a class of card type allowed for increased efficiency when producing the code

                    -> in other words, you need to also look at the functionality of what we want 
                    -> what we want comes in two parts, the look of the webpage (mockup) and the functionality (brief)
                    -> you need to go over both very carefully before taking action, or you could miss a detail like the cards are supposed to have 
                    links around them 
                    -> although this was done using the sandbox html file in this repo, adding these details in at a later date creates an unnecessary 
                    amount of work 
                    -> you need to know exactly what you want before you take action, the first part is the look of the webpage and the second part is 
                    the functionality
                    -> if you put links around a div at a later date, it can (in this case) change the appearance and widths of the elements inside those divs
                -->

            <!-- IMPORTANT LEARNING 2/2: MAKE THE CODE FLEXIBLE USING AN HTML SANDBOX -->
                    <!-- -> the second important learning from creating this section is to use a code sandbox 
                    -> it can help to have a second sandbox.html file in addition to the index.html file for the main page 
                    -> you can use this second html file for creating atoms (reusable elements on the webpage from the mockup) and then pasting them 
                    into the master index.html file
                    -> this can link to the same css file as the index.html file does and can give separation between the elements
                    -> it is important to maintain flexible code, e.g if the requirements about what we want change
                    -> in this case, changes were made to the mockup a month into the project (certain elements on the webpage were made bold, later created
                    in the html sandbox file in this repo) and in others clients may request a certain number of changes made to the webpage 
                    -> it is important to keep code flexible in case changes are made to one of the atoms on the webpage (in which case having these 
                    atoms isolated in a separate index.html file can be of use, change one and paste the new one into the master html document etc) -->

            <!--  problem solving thought process for the 'things to do in Paris' problem
                    -> what we want 
                        -> if we think about it in terms of atoms and molecules 
                        -> the biggest thing we have is the div around all 4 of the little cards
                        -> they look like they're flexboxed into a row inside it 
                        -> then the next smallest elements we have are those cards
                        -> they look like the previous cards on the webpage - so we can potentially reuse some of the code from them
                        -> then inside those cards themselves it looks like the content is flexboxed into a column
                        -> i.e with an image and then a subtitle
                    -> what we know 
                        -> generally the best approach is to start from the bottom up (smallest elements first)
                        -> we know the code from the previous sections with cards which look quite similar to these - we can reuse that code
                        -> the h3 headings - they have weird margins which need resetting - this was the problem we encountered last time
                        -> we know the files for the images which we can download from Figma
                        -> images are inserted with <img> tags and those have no closing tag
                        -> the various margins from Figma
                        -> the cards have been flexboxed horizontally 
                    -> bridges 
                        -> the approach is to reuse as much of the code from the previous section as possible - because the cards for this
                            section look like the cards from the previous sections
                        -> I would 
                            -> download everything 
                                - get the images from Figma into the file directories we want 
                                -> don't name them with spaces or it will create problems - or do and use %20's 
                            -> reuse the code from the previous section - to try and make one of the cards in the sandbox 
                            -> this will require paragraph sections 
                            -> play around with it in css to make it match the mockup 
                            -> then make four of them
                            -> then put a div around all of them 
                            -> then flexbox them into a row using a class
                            -> then combine that with the rest of the code on the webpage (move it from the sandbox section of the index.html file back up 
                            to the top)
                    -> learnings after doing the section
                        -> naming conventions for file directories 
                            -> the spaces in the relative file paths are %20's - this was one of the issues resolved when validating the html with the 
                            w3c html validator
                            -> make the file structure as simple as possible and at the end go back and delete what you're not using 
                            -> then 
                        -> look out for the margins on h3 headings - sometimes they can have default margins, this was an issue 
                            - fix it by resetting the h3 margins and then inspecting them in the console
                        -> the 'reuse the code from the previous sections' strategy is one which works but also has to be done very carefully 
                            because there are differences between the code for the cards from the previous sections and the ones from this section
                            (e.g., the flex direction in this case)

                            - we have this section of the mockup which we are attacking
                            -> you break it up into smaller parts

                            -> then you will be faced with the problem of combining them 
                            -> this is a lot more technical than making the elements themselves
                            -> and you might need to change the elements, rather than combine them - in other words
                                if you are having problems combining them then there might be something wrong with how you made them in the 
                                first place (e.g with widths)
                        -> repeating certain sections of code is also something which seems to work (in this case it was making one third of the
