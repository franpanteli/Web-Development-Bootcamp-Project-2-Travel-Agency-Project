<h2> 2i About This Project </h2>

<p>This repository contains my work for the second project in the twelve-week AMSxOpenClassrooms web development skills bootcamp. This skills bootcamp consisted firstly of video lectures and tutorials on the OpenClassrooms platform, followed by three practical assessed web development projects. This repository consists of my course files for the website I produced as part of the second project this bootcamp.</p>   

<p><strong>Booki (https://fran-web-dev-bootcamp-project-2.netlify.app desktops & large desktops only): </strong> The second project in this web development bootcamp was for a travel agency called Booki. This was an intensive six-week project, designed to develop the HTML and CSS skills of its students. This provided us with a mockup of the Booki travel agency webpage in Figma and tasked us with converting it into a webpage. This was with a series of courses on the OpenClassrooms platform, mentoring sessions and live skills webinars. Similarly, this was assessed with a second thirty-minute presentation on the OpenClassrooms platform.</p>

<h2>2ii Course Notes </h2>
<p>Booki is the second web development project I completed during this bootcamp and was produced to develop HTML and CSS skills. The aim of this was to develop these skills by completing the course material and to apply this knowledge by converting the mockup of a travel agency called Booki into a webpage. This mockup was provided in Figma.</p>

For this, three further courses were first completed on the OpenClassrooms platform. My notes from these may be found in the folder called '2i Booki Course Notes by Fran_Panteli' and further information about them is detailed below.

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Design a Mock-up for Web Development With Figma </strong> - the first course was a 6-hour long course on wireframes and mockups in Figma. This was taught by Alexia Toulmet and Mike Miello</li>
  <li><strong>Create Web Page Layouts With CSS</strong> - the second was a 10-hour long course which included Flexbox, 2D layouts with the CSS grid, CSS positioning techniques and legacy layouts. This was produced by Emily Reese</li>
  <li><strong>Break Down and Integrate a Mockup</strong> - the latter was a 6-hour-long course covering breaking down and integrating a mockup. This was also produced by Emily Reese</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Problem Solving Thought Proccess</h4>
<p>The second stage following completion of these courses was converting the Booki mockup from Figma into a webpage using HTML and CSS in VSCode. To do this, I repurposed the problem solving approach I garnered from my studies in Physics. This problem solving approach is:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Write down what you want</li>
		<li>Write down what you know</li>
		<li>Write down the different ways (you know of) to get there</li>
		<li>Pick the way which is the most likely to work</li>
		<li>Execute the chosen method as carefully as possible</li> 
		<li>If it fails, write down your learnings and try the next most likely-to-work approach, carry on until you exhaust all options</li> 
		<li>If the approach you try works, then analyse the results to see if they can withstand testing, make sense and match the mockup</li>
</ol>

<p>The approach I found that worked for this project was to treat each section of the mockup as its own problem to be solved. I systematised this approach by annotating the index.html file for this project with these problem solving thought processes. These thought processes may be found in the comments of the files in the repository called '2ii Booki Website by Fran_Panteli.zip' and the deployed project may be found at the netlify links in the next section of this 'read me' document.</p>

<p>I worked through these problems using a snowballing approach, by solving the easiest one first and building. In order to improve this, I would first work on developing the atoms and most repeatable building blocks of the webpage in a separate HTML sandbox before solving any of these problems. This would be in order to make the code more repurposable should changes to its elements be required (e.g if the project mockup changed).</p>

<h4>Webpage Links (Desktops, Large Desktops)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>https://fran-web-dev-bootcamp-project-2.netlify.app - This is the link to the webpage I created using VSCode called Booki </li>
</ul>

<h4>Media Queries</h4>
<p>Media queries were used to enable the page to operate on desktops and large desktops, as per its project brief. There is a void region below the desktop breakpoint where the background of the page turns green, to indicate that the mobile breakpoint region has been entered (below which the behaviour of the webpage is irrelevant to its brief). It was found that defining the width of elements on the webpage as percentages enabled this page resizing. </p>

<h4>A Refined Approach to the Problem Solving Thought Proccess for Booki</h4>

<p>One point to note from this project was the importance of identifying the exact requirements of the project before it was undertaken. In the first stage of the problem solving thought process ('write down what you want'), it was found that the requirements of the Booki webpage existed in two main forms. The first, being the <u>functionality</u> of the webpage and the second being its <u>styling</u> and precise dimensions. While <u>the prior was provided from the project brief, the latter was provided by its mockup</u> in Figma. This shows the importance of using the two in tandem during stage 1 of the problem solving thought process. </p>

<p>In order to garner a full view of what the project requirements are, its functionality and dimensions must first be understood (rather than solely its dimensions). Understanding the exact requirements of the Booki webpage was one of the most important stages of this project. Many students omitted certain elements of the project brief in stage 1 of the problem solving thought process, which created more work closer to its deadline and unforeseen challenges.</p>

<p>It was also noted during the project that 'what you want' may change. In this example, changes were made to the mockup for the project in Figma halfway through its completion. It was found that the approach which worked to manage this challenge was the use of an HTML sandbox. In this case, this was a separate HTML file which was linked to the same CSS document as the main index.html file. This sandbox isolated atoms on the page, which meant that when changes were made to core atoms on the webpage in its mockup, they would already be isolated in the sandbox for editing. </p>

<p> If I were to repeat this project, I would refine my problem solving approach by first creating an HTML sandbox with the atoms of the webpage. This would allow them to be isolated and ready for editing should changes to the mockup later be made. Secondly, I would split my attention in the first stage of the problem solving thought process both across the functionality and appearance of the webpage, rather than primarily on its appearance and later its functionality in stage 7 of problem solving. Focusing more on the functionality of the webpage in the first stage in the problem solving process would mitigate more unforeseen challenges that come with managing them during stage 7. While the approach used was successful, these are means which could be used to increase its efficiency.</p>

<h3> 2iv Booki Public Speaking Skills Assessment</h3>
<p>This project was examined in a 30 minute oral presentation I gave on the OpenClassrooms platform, to develop public speaking and presentation skills. My flashcards from this assessment are available in the repository called '2iii Booki Assessment.'</p>
